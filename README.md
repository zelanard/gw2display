# GW2Display

## API Screen
To use this app you need to go to login to your guild wars 2 account at https://account.arena.net/login and get your API key.
Enter your API key into the API screen and press Add Key. The key is now added to your list of keys.

## Character List
The character list is generated from the api key. Select a character to see build and equipment.

## Switching View
The content of the character screen (what is shown after you select a character) may be changed either with the tab menu at the bottom, or by rotating your phone.
Note that Equipmnet is shown on Portrait and Landscape-Right while Build is shown on portrait-upsidedown and Landscape-Left.
If your phone does not have built in portrait-upsidedown, but does support it, you can download an app from the appstore to control this.

## Build
The build screen shows the characters Lands Skills, Aquatic Skills and Specializations.

## Equipment
The Equipmnet screen shows the characters Armor, Weapons, Trinkets and Tools.
